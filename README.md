# Stochastic-NN
Fully Hardware-Based Stochastic Neural Network

This project demonstrates fully harware-based neural networks which perform calculations entirely through stochastic signal processing. This code in this project is mainly written in Verilog HDL with tcl macros to be used for ModelSim simulations. However, the code can be easily adapted for FPGA implementations.
