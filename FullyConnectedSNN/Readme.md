This project demonstrates a network with 5 inputs, two fully connected hidden layers with 25 and 8 nodes and 5 output nodes. 

To run the project in ModelSim, navigate to the .../FullyConnectedSNN/ directory and run the compilation + simulation macro file with: "do nn.do"

The waveform window will show the training progress including the netowork parameters and stochastic error:
